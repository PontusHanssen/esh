We know for a fact that car maintainance is expensive, 
we know that driving is a major source of pullution and 
we know that people die every day in car related accidents.

To drive more eco-friendly, 
more safe and to keep your car in a good shape, 
we have created CurBit - FitBit  - but for cars.

CurBit visualizes driving statistics collected by Actia's ACU-III box. 
We combine real-time data from the box with open data from Trafikverket and SMHI, 
such as road condition and weather 
in order to alert drivers and encourage them to drive more safe through our
smartphone app, 
something your average speedometer just can't do.  


The distraction free driving-mode is beneficial for you as a driver as you
get advice and feedback presented in a way where you can see the actual 
consequences of your driving, for example increased stopping distance and the 
neglectable time you will save by speeding.
Your achieved driving score can used by insurance companies, car rentals or employers 
to prove that you are a good and responsible driver.

Once you have reached your destination our application enables you to compare and
explore your own, and friends' trips. 
This way, driving safe and enviroment-friendly 
becomes a fun and social came - Now you can settle, once and for all,
who is really the best driver?
