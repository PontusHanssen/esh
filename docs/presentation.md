# Presentation

## Name of Application 

## Open Data
* Actia box
..- Velocity
..- Fuel Consumption

* Trafikverket (actually SMHI though)
..- Speedlimits
..- Road conditions

* Combined
..- Score based on parameters from the box such as distance of the trip, fuel consumed, speed combined with speedlimits from trafikverket 
..- Velocity stats based on road conditions, speed limit and speed.

## Contributions

### Enviroment
* Fuel Consumption
* Score

### Safety
* Velocity feedback, earned time and increased breaking distance 
* Warnings, slippery roads, road construction, accidents, queues

### Challange that triggers good behaviour
* Social, highscores
* Decrease driven distance over time
* Decrease fuel consumption

## NEW Components
* Warning module:  slippery roads, road construction, accidents, queues SAFETY
* Fuel consumption per km per day ENVIRONMENT
* Distance driven each day over time, much like the fuel consumption graph ENVIROMENT
